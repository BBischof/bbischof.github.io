A place for my continued toying with puzzles. 538 puzzles, WACan't, and others.

<!-- ^Spoiler Text^ -->
## Finnegan's Quaternions

The ever distracting `Wolfram Alpha Can't` Twitter account, ensnared me a few days ago with this [tweet](https://twitter.com/wacnt/status/864631759954161666)

Which asked for all the `i`s, `j`s, and `k`s from Finnegan's wake, to be taken in order to be a quaternionic product. The problem wasn't the most fascinating, but just silly enough.

Here's a [gist](https://gist.github.com/BBischof/560352b5da927758487df8882512a845) of my solution. I definitely think that the multiplication function could be more elegant, but c'est la vie. I _was_ happy that I thought to use `reduce`.

## Billiard's racks

Another distracting Twitter account is solve my maths, who retweeted this [little puppy](https://twitter.com/aap03102/status/859645194806996992).

This problem was a little meatier. It asks if you can rearrange the pool balls in a billiards rack such that each ball is the difference of the two balls below it(excluding the bottom row). I liked how this problem immediately starts suggesting some data structures.

My mental model for how to construct a `rack` was to start in the lower-left corner, and add a ball to the bottom row at a time, and stop when it becomes impossible. Then, running through all the ball orderings, will return only the racks that make it all the way.

So I started with a row object, and then a rack object. The rows have `append`, and the racks have `add_ball`. The rack needs `fill_last` because it didn't cleanly fit into the paradigm of `add_ball`; also added a `print_rack` function for obvious reasons.

The logic is straightforward, and starts with two balls:

```python
def __init__(self, leftmost, secondleftmost, operation=delta, rack_size=5):
    if (leftmost != secondleftmost and leftmost != 2*secondleftmost and 2*leftmost != secondleftmost):
        self.operation=operation
        self.rack_size=rack_size
        self.rows = [row(rack_size, leftmost)]
        self.rows[0].append(secondleftmost)
        self.remaining_balls = list(range(1,((rack_size*(rack_size+1))/2)+1))
        self.remaining_balls.remove(leftmost)
        self.remaining_balls.remove(secondleftmost)
        self.fill_last()
    else:
        raise ValueError("Incorrect Starting Configuration")
```

That `fill_last()` is doing the work of moving up a row, and adding the necessary ball in the third position. You'll see that this function will get called every time a ball is added to the rack, but only for the topmost ball necessaryâ€”the top of whatever triangle exists.

```python
def fill_last(self):
    current_last_length = self.rack_size+1-len(self.rows)
    diff = self.operation(self.rows[-1].elements[0], self.rows[-1].elements[1])
    if diff in self.remaining_balls:
        self.rows.append(row(current_last_length,diff))
        self.remaining_balls.remove(diff)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Impossible Rack")
```

So now, we just keep adding balls to the bottom row, and then filling out the rows above, and finishing off with `fill_last()`:

```python
def add_ball(self, value):
    if value in self.remaining_balls:
        self.rows[0].append(value)
        self.remaining_balls.remove(value)
        for i in range(1,len(self.rows[0].elements)-1):
            diff = self.operation(self.rows[i-1].elements[-1],self.rows[i-1].elements[-2])
            if diff in self.remaining_balls:
                self.rows[i].append(diff)
                self.remaining_balls.remove(diff)
            else:
                raise ValueError("Impossible Rack")
        self.fill_last()
        return self.remaining_balls
    else:
        raise ValueError("Impossible Rack")
```

This is all well and good, and does yield a solution for the original problem if you iterate through all the possibilities, but I wanted to see the evolution of these solutions, i.e. as you add balls, how many racks are floating around. First, this code does the iteration:

```python
def solve_puzzle(puzzle_size, operation=delta):
    if puzzle_size<3 or puzzle_size>7:
        raise ValueError("Change your puzzle size")
    rack_list = []
    number_of_balls = ((puzzle_size*(puzzle_size+1))/2)+1
    for i in range(1,number_of_balls):
        for j in [x for x in range(1,number_of_balls) if x != i]:
            try:
                rack_list.append(rack(i, j, operation, puzzle_size))
            except ValueError:
                pass
```

And then I got a wild hair and wrote this atrocity:

```python
new_rack = None
some_racks = None
def compute_subracks(new_rack):
    some_racks = []
    for ball in new_rack.remaining_balls:
        try:
            sub_rack = copy.deepcopy(new_rack)
            sub_rack.add_ball(ball)
            some_racks.append(sub_rack)
        except ValueError:
            pass
    return some_racks

def print_rack_tree(root_rack, puzzle_size):
    possibility_counts = {3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0}
    for r in compute_subracks(root_rack):
        possibility_counts[3]+=1
        if puzzle_size>=4:
            for s in compute_subracks(r):
                possibility_counts[4]+=1
                if puzzle_size>=5:
                    for k in compute_subracks(s):
                        possibility_counts[5]+=1
                        if puzzle_size>=6:
                            for m in compute_subracks(k):
                                possibility_counts[6]+=1
                                if puzzle_size>=7:
                                    for n in compute_subracks(m):
                                        possibility_counts[7]+=1
                                        n.print_rack()
                                else:
                                    m.print_rack()
                        else:
                            k.print_rack()
                else:
                    s.print_rack()
        else:
            r.print_rack()
    return possibility_counts
```

which, omg, I _cannot for the life of me_ refactor to be recursive. I have tried like 3 times and keep messing it up. It _clearly_ should be recursive, but it's above my pay-grade.

So now, a little word on these counts:

```python
global_counts = {2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0}
for r in rack_list:
    global_counts[2]+=1
    counts = print_rack_tree(r,puzzle_size)
    for val in counts:
        global_counts[val]+=counts[val]
return global_counts
```

Which is going to yield the sequence leading up to a solution. Without further ado:

```python
print solve_puzzle(5)
```

returns

```
row 4:         [5]
row 3:       [4, 9]
row 2:     [7, 11, 2]
row 1:   [8, 1, 12, 10]
row 0: [6, 14, 15, 3, 13]
Remaining: []
row 4:         [5]
row 3:       [9, 4]
row 2:     [2, 11, 7]
row 1:   [10, 12, 1, 8]
row 0: [13, 3, 15, 14, 6]
Remaining: []
{2: 196, 3: 1574, 4: 1734, 5: 2}
```

I know whatcha thinking, I was thinking it too. What about the racks for larger numbers(the astute reader will have noticed how often I left these functions to take `n`). Let's look at 6:

```
{2: 400, 3: 5516, 4: 25994, 5: 3182, 6: 0}
```

No solution! Damn! But 3182 racks get to the level 5 before they fail at 6. Take note that the number of balls is larger, so there are more degrees of freedom here. Here are the first four it spits out, it'd be curious to see if there is some common structure, but there are a lot to look at.

```
row 4:         [4]
row 3:       [5, 9]
row 2:     [7, 12, 3]
row 1:   [13, 6, 18, 15]
row 0: [1, 14, 20, 2, 17]
Remaining: [8, 10, 11, 16, 19, 21]
row 4:         [5]
row 3:       [4, 9]
row 2:     [7, 11, 2]
row 1:   [13, 6, 17, 15]
row 0: [1, 14, 20, 3, 18]
Remaining: [8, 10, 12, 16, 19, 21]
row 4:         [4]
row 3:       [5, 9]
row 2:     [6, 11, 2]
row 1:   [13, 7, 18, 16]
row 0: [1, 14, 21, 3, 19]
Remaining: [8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20]
row 4:         [6]
row 3:       [2, 8]
row 2:     [9, 11, 3]
row 1:   [14, 5, 16, 13]
row 0: [1, 15, 20, 4, 17]
Remaining: [7, 10, 12, 18, 19, 21]
```

Seven is similarly dissapointing, and so I'm just guessing that 5 is the upper bound for a solution(I'm going to try to prove this at some point, but I'm a bit lazy and uninspired).

Ok, so what about 4?

```
row 3:       [3]
row 2:     [4, 7]
row 1:   [5, 9, 2]
row 0: [6, 1, 10, 8]
Remaining: []
row 3:       [3]
row 2:     [5, 2]
row 1:   [4, 9, 7]
row 0: [6, 10, 1, 8]
Remaining: []
row 3:       [3]
row 2:     [2, 5]
row 1:   [7, 9, 4]
row 0: [8, 1, 10, 6]
Remaining: []
row 3:       [4]
row 2:     [2, 6]
row 1:   [5, 7, 1]
row 0: [8, 3, 10, 9]
Remaining: []
row 3:       [3]
row 2:     [7, 4]
row 1:   [2, 9, 5]
row 0: [8, 10, 1, 6]
Remaining: []
row 3:       [4]
row 2:     [5, 1]
row 1:   [2, 7, 6]
row 0: [8, 10, 3, 9]
Remaining: []
row 3:       [4]
row 2:     [1, 5]
row 1:   [6, 7, 2]
row 0: [9, 3, 10, 8]
Remaining: []
row 3:       [4]
row 2:     [6, 2]
row 1:   [1, 7, 5]
row 0: [9, 10, 3, 8]
Remaining: []
{2: 80, 3: 262, 4: 8}
```

And 3(for completeness)?

```
row 2:     [3]
row 1:   [5, 2]
row 0: [1, 6, 4]
Remaining: []
row 2:     [3]
row 1:   [4, 1]
row 0: [2, 6, 5]
Remaining: []
row 2:     [2]
row 1:   [3, 5]
row 0: [4, 1, 6]
Remaining: []
row 2:     [3]
row 1:   [2, 5]
row 0: [4, 6, 1]
Remaining: []
row 2:     [1]
row 1:   [3, 4]
row 0: [5, 2, 6]
Remaining: []
row 2:     [3]
row 1:   [1, 4]
row 0: [5, 6, 2]
Remaining: []
row 2:     [2]
row 1:   [5, 3]
row 0: [6, 1, 4]
Remaining: []
row 2:     [1]
row 1:   [4, 3]
row 0: [6, 2, 5]
Remaining: []
{2: 24, 3: 8}
```

You may think at this point "Can we stop talking about this?", or you may think "what about if it was add instead of difference?":

Nope. Not even a little. With enough balls for a rack of size 6, there are only 7 additive 4-racks! Wild!

This is all in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/BBischof/d3968457dda2a9deb6cc7c710c27dd35).

## Letter-place frequencies

[This one](https://twitter.com/wacnt/status/847961924813848576) also originated from Wolfram Alpha Can't, and asks about the most common letter, by place, by length of word.

I just love this question so much. The solution doesn't take much work, just a little bashy loop:

```bash
for i in `seq 1 15`; do
    for j in `seq 1 $i`; do
              { cat /usr/share/dict/words | awk "length($1) == $i { print tolower($1) }" | sort | uniq | awk -v j="$j" '{print tolower(substr($0,j,1))}' | sort | uniq -c | awk '{print $2, $1}' | sort -nk2 | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}'; } | tr "\n " " " | tr -d '[:space:]';
    done
    printf "\n"
done
```

which has the added fun of making "words" out of the answers.

I got really excited and wanted to look at a slightly more dramatic presentation, so I made [this](pic.twitter.com/aQjOOiZcRi) which I think is way cool! Check out those patterns!!!

## The 538-multiplication problem

This is one of the [Puzzlers](https://twitter.com/ollie/status/850356577446055936), and I like the official solutions, but I also kinda like my work on it:

```
10k sims:
random_placement: 2321,
mean_method: 1083,
thresh: (4, 4, 3, 1072),
cond_thresh: (4, 4, 3, 1072),
perfect: (4, 4, 3, 875)
```

And some cool [pics](https://twitter.com/BEBischof/status/852372470707269632).

## End matter

All for now, always more though. Let me know if you find a puzzle that I might like, or you have some input on the above.
